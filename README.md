# Self-supervised learning with Image GPT

Part of the code here is adapted from [Andrej Karpathy's minimalistic GPT (minGPT) implementation](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT). 

Brief description of some of the code files: 

* [`train.py`](https://github.com/eminorhan/igpt/blob/master/train.py): trains an iGPT model on images/frames.
* [`test.py`](https://github.com/eminorhan/igpt/blob/master/train.py): tests an iGPT model.
* [`generate.py`](https://github.com/eminorhan/igpt/blob/master/generate.py): generate samples from an iGPT model.

Please see the shell scripts for usage examples. Work in progress, more details to follow.
